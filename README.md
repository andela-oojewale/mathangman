# Mathangman

Hi,
I have implemented the popular hangman game with ruby. You can play the game by selecting the difficulty level you prefer.
You will be prompted to guess letters of the alphabet that make up a randomly selected word by the computer. The minimum length of the word and the number of allowed wrong guesses depends on your chosen difficulty level. You may chose to save the session of a started game and continue later. You may also save more than one game session.
Get your hands on the game and enjoy! Bug discoveries, suggestions and general feedback will always be appreciated.
Olaide.
